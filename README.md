## 1. Project overview

**Sayooj Chat App** is a responsive, modern chat web application built for demo and portfolio use. It demonstrates a full-featured frontend with a clean UI, intuitive chat interactions, and responsive layout so it works well on desktop and mobile browsers.

This README explains how to run the project locally, where the major files live, how to customize the app, and deployment steps (Netlify is used for the live site).

> Note: This repository contains the frontend client only. If the app in this repo uses a backend (for authentication, message storage, real-time socket server, etc.), that backend may be provided separately or replaced with mock/stubbed data for the demo.

## 2. Features

* Responsive UI (desktop + mobile)
* Horizontal/vertical chat layout depending on viewport
* Message input with basic controls (type, send)
* Simple user presence or mock avatars
* Theme support (light/dark toggle) — if implemented
* Client-side form validation for input fields
* Deployed to Netlify for instant static hosting

> If your version supports additional features (real-time via WebSocket / Socket.io, persistent chat history via an API, file uploads, etc.) add them here.

## 3. Tech stack

* **Frontend:** React (functional components + hooks)
* **Styling:** Bootstrap and/or custom CSS (or Tailwind if used)
* **Bundler:** Vite / Create React App (depending on repo)
* **Hosting:** Netlify (live demo hosted at the link above)
* **Optional:** EmailJS for contact form, Socket.io for real-time messaging, LocalStorage for persistence

## 4. Live demo

Visit the live demo at: [https://sayooj-chat-app.netlify.app/](https://sayooj-chat-app.netlify.app/)

Use the demo to validate layout, flows and to test responsiveness.

## 5. Screenshots

Place screenshots here (or in a docs/ folder) to show main views like chat list, chat conversation, mobile layout, and settings.

Example:

* `screenshots/home.png` — main chat list
* `screenshots/chat-window.png` — conversation view

## 6. Getting started (local development)

These steps assume you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create environment file (see next section)

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will run the app locally at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured). The console will show the exact URL.

## 7. Environment variables

If the app uses any external services (EmailJS, Firebase, a REST API, or a Socket server) create a `.env` file in the repo root and add these values. Example placeholders:

```
# For Create React App prefix REACT_APP_
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=wss://sockets.example.com
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

**Important:** Do not commit `.env` with real secret keys. Use Netlify environment variables for production.

## 8. Running tests

If the project includes tests, run:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

If there are no tests included, you can add basic unit tests with React Testing Library and Jest.

## 9. Building & deploying

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This produces an optimized `build/` (or `dist/`) folder ready to deploy.

### Deploy to Netlify (quick)

1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. Sign into Netlify and create a new site from Git.
3. Select your repository and set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `build` (for CRA) or `dist` (for Vite).
4. Add environment variables in Netlify settings if the app needs them.
5. Deploy and Netlify will build & host the site. The live URL will update automatically on push.

## 10. Folder structure (example)

```
├─ public/
│  ├─ index.html
│  └─ favicon.ico
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/         # images, icons, fonts
│  ├─ components/     # React components (NavBar, ChatList, ChatWindow, Message, Form, Alert)
│  ├─ pages/          # Page-level components (Home, About, Contact)
│  ├─ services/       # API / socket wrappers
│  ├─ styles/         # global styles, variables
│  ├─ utils/          # utility functions
│  ├─ App.js
│  └─ index.js
├─ .env
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

Adjust this section to match the actual repo structure.

## 11. Important components & how they work

* **NavBar** — top navigation with logo, links, and theme toggle. Controls global mode state (light/dark).
* **ChatList** — list of conversations or contacts. Clicking a conversation selects it and loads messages.
* **ChatWindow** — displays messages for the selected conversation, handles scrolling and new message rendering.
* **Message** — single message component (timestamp, sender, text, avatar).
* **MessageInput** — textarea/input for composing messages. Handles enter-to-send and paste.
* **Alert** — reusable alert component for success/error notifications (can plug into `showAlert` prop). If you used Bootstrap's dismissible alerts, ensure the component calls `setTimeout` or parent state to hide after a few seconds.

## 12. Styling & theming

* If you use Bootstrap, keep components compatible with Bootstrap utility classes.
* For theme support, maintain CSS variables (e.g. `--bg`, `--text`) and toggle a `.dark` class on `body` or root element.
* Use responsive units (rem, %) and media queries for small breakpoints (max-width: 768px for mobile).

## 13. Accessibility

* Add `aria-label` and `role` attributes to interactive elements.
* Ensure keyboard accessibility for the input and send actions (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline).
* Provide `alt` text for images/avatars.
* Ensure color contrast is sufficient in both light and dark themes.

## 14. Performance tips

* Lazy-load heavy components with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.
* Avoid re-rendering large message lists — use `memo`, `useMemo`, and virtualization (`react-window`) if the message list can be very long.
* Compress images and use `srcset` for responsive images.

## 15. Troubleshooting

**Problem:** App won't start or `npm start` fails.

* Make sure Node.js (v16+) and npm/yarn are installed.
* Delete `node_modules` and reinstall (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).
* If you see errors related to packages like MUI components, check package versions and compatibility.

**Problem:** Styling broken or MUI imports fail.

* Ensure correct versions of material packages are installed. Some MUI packages expect peer dependencies; run `npm ls @mui/material` to inspect.
* If you replaced MUI `Alert` with Bootstrap alerts, make sure the component imports and files are updated.

**Problem:** Alerts show `showAlert is not a function`.

* Ensure parent component passes `showAlert` as a function prop to the child component. Example:

```jsx
// Parent (App.js)
const showAlert = (msg, type) => setAlert({ msg, type });
<Form showAlert={showAlert} />
```

```jsx
// Child (Form.js)
export default function Form({ showAlert }) {
  // call showAlert('Saved', 'success')
}
```

**Problem:** EmailJS errors or missing imports.

* Use `npm install @emailjs/browser` and import as `import emailjs from '@emailjs/browser';`.
* Check your service/template/public keys and set them as environment variables.

If you need more specific help, include the exact error message and a snippet of the failing code.

### Final notes

Update any section above to match your repository's real structure, scripts, and used services. This README is a comprehensive template designed so you can drop it into the repo and update a couple of placeholders (repository URL, environment variable keys, screenshots, and contact email).

If you want, I can also:

* Generate a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
* Create example `.env.example` with the keys used by the app.
* Produce a minimal `netlify.toml` for custom redirects or headers.
